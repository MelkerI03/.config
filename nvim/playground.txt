suppose you only know four motions, w, $, }, g and only one operator, d. you can do 8 actions: move 4 different ways (w, $, }, g) and delete 4 
different targets (dw, d$, d}, dg). then one day you learn about the uppercase (gu) operator. you have added not just one new ability to your vim tool
belt, but four: guw, gu$, gu}, gug. this makes at 12 tools in your vim tool belt. each new knowledge is a multiplier to your current abilities. if you
know 10 motions and 5 operators, you have 60 moves (50 operations + 10 motions) in your arsenal. vim has a line-number motion (ng) that gives you n 
motions, where n is how many lines you have in your file (to go to line 5, run 5g). the search motion (/) practically gives you near unlimited number 
motions because you can search for anything. external command operator (!) gives you as many filtering tools as the number of terminal commands you 
know. using a composable tool like vim, everything you know can be linked together to do operations with increasing complexity. the more you know, 
the more powerful you become.
